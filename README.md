# Analysis of GHG Emissions due to Agriculture Production

## Overview: 
The production of agriculture and food involves the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), which are responsible for the climate change. Environmental organizations constantly monitor the level of the emissions across all countries to make sure they comply with the regulations and to implement new policies where needed.

## Objective:
This project aims to analyze worldwide emissions from agriculture and establish the relationship between the emission levels and economic indicators to help environmental organizations implement new policies.

## Data: 
4 datasets were used for this project:
- Greenhouse gas emissions
- Temperature changes
- Populatiion
- contains global information on emissions, population, and macroeconomic indicators within the agricultural sector.
Data was obtained from FAOSTAT â€“ the statistics division of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and is available here: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data.

## Data Cleaning Process and Challenges:
- Unnecessary columns were dropped, and all of the columns were renamed to keep the consistensy.
- Datasets were checked for duplicates (none found), columns were checked for mixed-type data, and missing values. Records with missing values were removed as they were less than 1% of the dataset.
- Descriptive statistics was calculated for each dataset and no unrealistic/unusual values were found.
- The datasets were merged on three key columns: 'Country Code', 'Country', 'Year'. Cleaned dataset have 84,960 rows and 8 columns.
- CHALLENGE: Categorical values were transposed into separate columns using

## Exploratory Analysis:
- Built a heatmap to check the correlation between all variables and created a parplot to visualize the relationship between variables.
- Made hypotheses based on the correlation findings.
First hypothesis: Countries with large population release more emissions.
Second hypothesis: Total GHG emisisons couse bigger temperature chenges in 4 years.
